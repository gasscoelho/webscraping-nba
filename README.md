## Built With

‚ú®Python <br />
‚ú®Pandas <br />
‚ú®Selenium <br />

## Dessert üç®

One of the challenges faced during the development of this project was how to make sure to execute the app container only after the Selenium container was ready. The `depends_on` property in the docker-compose file will only set the order of the execution and not in fact wait for the process to be ready. So, to achieve that behavior, I used the `docker-compose-wait` tool.

This tool is a command-line utility that facilitates the orchestration of services by making a docker image to start only after other docker images are ready while using docker-compose.

Check their [repository](https://github.com/ufoscout/docker-compose-wait) to know more about the tool and how to use it.
